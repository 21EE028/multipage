    <h1>History of barabarika</h1>
    <p1>Barbarika (Barbarīka) Barbarika in Hindu history is the son of Ghatotkacha (Son of Bhima) and Princess Maurvi, daughter of Daitya Moora, though other references state that he was a warrior from the south. He was a character in the Mahabharata, a warrior who could change the outcome of battle in just few minute</p1>

    <h2>His legendary arrows</h2>
    <p2>Barbarika/ Belarsen was a grandson of Bhima (second of the Pandava brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. <br>Ghatotkacha was the son of Bhima and Hidimbi.<br> He learnt the art of warfare from his mother Ahilāvati who was also known as Mauravi (daughter of Mura) and The gods (ashtadeva) gave him the three infallible arrows.The Brahmin appeared in his divine form. Yeah well, your guess is quite right here. The Brahmin was none other than Krishna. “Before giving your head in charity, ask for anything you want”, proposed Krishna. Barbarika touched his feet and asked him that he wish to see the forthcoming battle of Kurukshetra to which Krishna agreed. He placed Barbarika’s head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle of Mahabharata.

        The victory of Pandava brothers filled pride in them. While Arjuna was arrogant about his archery skills, Bhima was proud of his clubbing skills. “Only the one who saw the entire battle is qualified to select the real winner”, said Krishna.
        
        They went on the hill and asked Barbarika’s head who he thinks is the actual reason behind the victory. “All I witnessed was Sudarshan Chakra revolving everywhere destroying Adharma and Mata Draupadi as Mahakali Durga quenching her thirst for Kauravas blood without allowing even a single drop of blood to fall on the Earth,” said Barbarika. Pandavas realized that it was Lord Narayana and Goddess Parvati (Mahakali) who actually destroyed evil, while they were mere instruments.
        
        Pandava’s after the end of war questioned Krishna why he asked for Barbarika’s head? There could have been another way.
        
        Krishna explained, “In Barbarik’s previous birth, he was a Yaksha. When the adharma (wickedness) went par the limits on earth, Devas (Gods) came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu. Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Meanwhile, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all the evil elements on the Earth. Lord Brahma witnessing his arrogance cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. To fulfill the curse, I, Krishna asked for his head in charity before eliminating all the evil forces on Earth.”
        
         
        
        Barbarika as Khatu Shyam Ji in Kaliyug –
        Obliged by the sacrifice of Barbarika, Krishna grants him a boon. “You will be wholeheartedly worshipped by the name of Shyam in my form when Kaliyug arrives. The devotees who will seek your blessing would be granted their wishes.”
        
        As a result of Krishna’s boon, We now worship Barbarika in the form of Khatu Shyamji. The famous temple named Khatu Shyamji is located in the Sikar district of Rajasthan. There is a Shyam pond at a little distance from the temple where the head of Shri Shyamji had appeared. Many devotees believe that by bathing in that pond, the diseases of the body are cured.</p2>
