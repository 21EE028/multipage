    <h1>History of VAALI</h1>
    <p1>He was the husband of Tara, the son of Indra, the elder brother of Sugriva, and the father of Angada. Having obtained a boon that allowed him to receive half the strength of his opponents, Vali was a formidable fighter. He banished his brother Sugriva who had assumed his throne, believing him to be dead.Ravana learns about Vali and his strengths through Narada. Hearing Narada praising Vali, Ravana became extremely arrogant and went to Kishkindha. There Vali was in meditation. Ravana challenged Vali to come and fight. First Sugriva fought with Ravana and was defeated. Ravana then reached Vali and challenged him. Vali and Ravana then fought a fierce battle. Vali tied him with his tail (carried him on his shoulders in some other versions) and then arrested Ravana. Vali started carrying Ravana under his armpit for years.[5] Ravana could not bear the insult, He accepted his defeat and pleaded with Vali to release him. Ravana was impressed with Vali's strength and asked him for friendship.</p1>

    <h2> Early Life</h2>
    <p2>According to the epic, fourteen types of gems or treasures were produced from the churning of the ocean during the time of the Kurma avatar. One gem is that various apsaras (divine nymphs) were produced, and Tara was an apsara produced from the churning of the ocean. Vali, who was with his father Indra, helping him in the churning of the ocean, took Tara and married her.[citation needed]

        Vali was courageous. This can be understood from the fact that, when Tara tried to stop him and begged him not to go to fight Sugriva, by saying that it is Rama who is helping Sugriva and has come to Sugriva's rescue, Vali replied to Tara that even if he is fighting against God, he cannot ignore a challenge for a fight and remain quiet. He adds that even if the caller for the fight had been his own son, Angada, he would still go to the fight.</p2>
